Joke API

This project was my second project in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. It consisted of creating a React app in a 48-hour time frame with my GA classmate Michael Henderson. 

We deployed the app using Netlify.

Deployed Project: https://joke-api.netlify.app/


Technologies Used:
- JavaScript ES6
- React.js 
- HTML5
- CSS
- Axios 
- Insomnia REST Client 
- Yarn
- react-router-dom 
- The external API used: https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/?ref=apilist.fun#getting-started

Overview:

The app's main function was to render a random selection of jokes from the external API depending on the category chosen by the site visitor. The visitor can then choose to rate the joke out of 5 stars. Once a joke had been rated, it was stored in the rated jokes page using local storage. A button can be clicked to clear the saved jokes in order to make room for new ones.
